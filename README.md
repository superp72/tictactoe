## Overview of: Tic Tac Toe

![](http://www.optometrystudents.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/Jogo_da_velha_-_tic_tac_toe.png)

### The game

[Tic-Tac-Toe](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tic-tac-toe) is a two-player game and is probably something that you've played before, but feel free to read up on it.

## Project Details

### Necessary features

A basic implementation of this project must include:

1. An interactive board which renders on page load.
2. A way for players to set their name.
3. A way for players to mark an empty space on their turn. Their turns must alternate. Ex: Player one places an 'x' and then player two places an 'o', followed by player one placing an 'x', etc.
4. A player can't play on a square that has already been played.

### Intermediate features

5. The game should end when there is a winner, or if the game is a tie.
6. The game should report the end state.
7. A button on `game over` to **reset** the game back to initial state.
8. A way to keep track of Player 1 vs. Player 2 wins.

Additionally you should use the CSS skills that you've gained to ensure a reasonable amount of styling to keep your project presentable.

###  Advanced features

You can go above and beyond *should you have the time*.  

1. An option to play vs. a computer with AI
  - Level 1: Random empty space is good enough
  - Level 2: Computer chooses a space which immediately blocks a player win.


## Implementation

### Technologies

You will be expected to use the following technologies to implement this project:

- **HTML**  
  Your HTML should be semantic.

- **CSS**  
  Your game should be stylish.

- **JavaScript & jQuery**  
  Your game should be playable *and* responsive.


### Timeframe

Project kickoff is Monday, June 27th, and last day for development is Thursday, June 30.  We will be demoing our deployed applications on Friday, July 1st.

### Suggested Ways to Get Started
​
* **Wireframe** Make a drawing of what your app will look like on each page of your application (what does it look like as soon as you log on to the site? What does it look like once a user logs in, etc.).
* **Break the project down into different components** (data, presentation, views, style, DOM manipulation) and brainstorm each component individually. 
* **Use your Development Tools** (console.log, inspector, alert statements, etc) to debug and solve problems
* Work through the lessons in class for help and inspiration! Think about adding relevant code to your application each day - you are given 7 days so that you can work on it in small chunks, COMMIT OFTEN. We will be looking at your commit dates and comments are part of your scoring.
* **Commit early, commit often.** Don’t be afraid to break something because you can always go back in time to a previous version.
* **Consult documentation resources** (MDN, jQuery, etc.) at home to better understand what you’ll be getting into.
* **Don’t be afraid to write code that you know you will have to remove later.** Create temporary elements (buttons, links, etc) that trigger events if real data is not available. For example, if you’re trying to figure out how to change some text when the game is over but you haven’t solved the win/lose game logic, you can create a button to simulate that until then.
​

## Deliverables

By the time the project is over, we will expect the following from you:

* A **working application, built by you**, hosted somewhere on the internet
* A **link to your hosted working app** 
* A **git repository hosted on Github**  NOT inside your wdi-remote repository. Frequent commits dating back to the very beginning of the project
* **A ``readme.md`` file** with explanations of the technologies used, the approach taken, a link to your live site, installation instructions, unsolved problems, etc.

Most importantly a **technical demonstration** of your app which:

* Is 5 minutes in length
* Shows off all features of the app
* Explains the technical details
* Explains the technical challenges
* Explains which improvements you might make

## Project Feedback + Evaluation
​
* __Project Workflow__: Do you have a Github respository for your project (not inside your wdi-remote repo)? Did you complete the user stories, wireframes, and the README.md file as specified above? Did you use source control (Github commits) as expected for the phase of the program you’re in (detailed above)?
​
* __Technical Requirements__: Did you deliver a project that met all the technical requirements? Given what the class has covered so far, did you build something that was reasonably complex?
​
* __Creativity__: Did you add a personal spin or creative element into your project submission? Did you deliver something of value to the end user (not just a login button and an index page)?
​
* __Code Quality__: Did you follow code style guidance and best practices covered in class, such as spacing, modularity, and semantic naming? Did you comment your code as your instructors have in class?
​
* __Deployment__: Did you deploy your application to a public url?
​
* __Total__: Your instructors will give you a total score on your project between:
​
    
    Score | Category | Expectation | Expectation | Expectation | Expectation | Expectation |
    :-----: | ------------ | ---------------- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
    **6** | Project Workflow | Do you have a Github respository for your project (not inside your wdi-remote repo)? | Did you complete the user stories and are they in  your Github issues (2 points) | wireframes | README.md with specified information | source control with Github (commits) |
    **6** | Technical Requirements | Did you deliver a project that met all the technical requirements? (discussed in your MVP (a score between 1-3 will be given))| Given what the class has covered so far, did you build something that was reasonably complex? (complexity will be given a grade 1-3)  |
    **2** | Creativity | Did you add a personal spin or creative element into your project submission? | Did you deliver something of value to the end user (not just a login button and an index page)? |
    **2** | Code Quality | Did you follow code style guidance and best practices covered in class, such as spacing, modularity, and semantic naming? | Did you comment your code as your instructors have in class? |
    **2** | Deployment | Did you deploy your application to a public url? |
    **2** | Technical demonstration | Is 5 minutes in length & shows off all the features of your app. | Expalins technical details, technical challenges, and any improvements you might make. |
    _Maximum possible points_ | **20** |

# Project Week

## Attendance
You are required to be present by 10:00 am EDT each day during the project. You must also be present on Zoom each afternoon for attendance to be taken at 2:30 pm EDT.

## Standups
We will have student-run stand-ups each morning at 10:15 am EDT where you will answer the following questions:
- What did I work on yesterday
- What am i trying to get done today
- What is preventing me from getting this done.

This meeting should take no longer than 15 minutes.

If you have ideas on how you can help a fellow-student with work that they are stuck on, please follow-up with information AFTER the stand up.

## Meetings with instructors
_Your instructor will contact you to setup a meeting time_

**Monday, June 27**<br>
Work on your [MVP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimum_viable_product), user stories, and an initial wireframe. Setup your new project repo. You will have a 15 minute meeting to get your project approved.

**Tuesday, June 28**<br>
15 minute check in to see where you are with your project. 

**Wednesday, June 29**<br>
Refresher lesson on how to deploy to Github pages.

**Thursday, June 30**<br>
15 minute check in to see progress decide whether to move forward with or abandon stretch goals.

**Friday, July 1st**<br>
Submit your issue which should include a link to your live game and a link to your github repo by 10 am EDT and present your project.

## Where to go for help during project week
1. Seek out help online
2. Seek out help with your classmates
3. Seek out help with Derek (TA)
4. Submit a Github issue **on the wdi-remote** class Github account to receive help from an instructor

## Formatting your GitHub Issue for wdi-remote to ask for help

*PUSH OFTEN! Your code on GitHub should be up to date. Submiting an issue and linking us to old, out-of-date code will hinder the process.*

1. **WHAT YOU ARE TRYING TO SOLVE:**
  - Write a detailed explanation of the feature or user story you're working on.

2. **DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE BUG/ERROR:**
  - A detailed description of the problem, the bug, and/or the error. This means: the full steps to reproduce, a link to the file on github, and the line number of where the relavent code is.
The error(s) returned, copy and pasted/typed out/screenshot, not paraphrased.
  - If there is other code in a different file that is also essential to the functioning of the code that currently works point us to that and explain the relationship.

3. **WHAT I'VE TRIED**
  - List everything you've done to solve the bug on your own in detail. list all resources you've looked up and tried to implement and provide links. Providing code if you have it surrounded by the md syntax to display nicely is very helpful.

4. **QUESTION**
  - After going through all this what is your questions specifically, more specifically than how can I make this work?
